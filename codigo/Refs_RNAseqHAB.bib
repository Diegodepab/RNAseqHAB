@article{Thawng2023aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have been documenting the biological responses to low levels of radiation (natural background) and very low level radiation (below background), and thus these studies are testing mild external stimuli to which we would expect relatively mild biological responses. We recently published a transcriptome software comparison study based on RNA-Seqs from a below background radiation treatment of two model organisms, E. coli and C. elegans (Thawng and Smith, BMC Genomics 23:452, 2022). We reported DNAstar-D (Deseq2 in the DNAstar software pipeline) to be the more conservative, realistic tool for differential gene expression compared to other transcriptome software packages (CLC, Partek and DNAstar-E (using edgeR). Here we report two follow-up studies (one with a new model organism, Aedes aegypti and another software package (Azenta) on transcriptome responses from varying dose rates using three different sources of natural radiation.
RESULTS: When E. coli was exposed to varying levels of K40, we again found that the DNAstar-D pipeline yielded a more conservative number of DEGs and a lower fold-difference than the CLC pipeline and DNAstar-E run in parallel. After a 30 read minimum cutoff criterion was applied to the data, the number of significant DEGs ranged from 0 to 81 with DNAstar-D, while the number of significant DEGs ranged from 4 to 117 and 14 to 139 using DNAstar-E and the CLC pipelines, respectively. In terms of the extent of expression, the highest foldchange DEG was observed in DNAstar-E with 19.7-fold followed by 12.5-fold in CLC and 4.3-fold in DNAstar-D. In a recently completed study with Ae. Aegypti and using another software package (Azenta), we analyzed the RNA-Seq response to similar sources of low-level radiation and again found the DNAstar-D pipeline to give the more conservative number and fold-expression of DEGs compared to other softwares. The number of significant DEGs ranged 31-221 in Azenta and 31 to 237 in CLC, 19-252 in DNAstar-E and 0-67 in DNAStar-D. The highest fold-change of DEGs were found in CLC (1,350.9-fold), with DNAstar-E (5.9 -fold) and Azenta (5.5-fold) intermediate, and the lowest levels of expression (4-fold) found in DNAstar-D.
CONCLUSIONS: This study once again highlights the importance of choosing appropriate software for transcriptome analysis. Using three different biological models (bacteria, nematode and mosquito) in four different studies testing very low levels of radiation (Van Voorhies et al., Front Public Health 8:581796, 2020; Thawng and Smith, BMC Genomics 23:452, 2022; current study), the CLC software package resulted in what appears to be an exaggerated gene expression response in terms of numbers of DEGs and extent of expression. Setting a 30-read cutoff diminishes this exaggerated response in most of the software tested. We have further affirmed that DNAstar-Deseq2 gives a more conservative transcriptome expression pattern which appears more suitable for studies expecting subtle gene expression patterns.},

@article{Thawng2022aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of four software tools: DNAstar-D (DESeq2), DNAstar-E (edgeR), CLC Genomics and Partek Flow for identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a transcriptome of E. coli. The RNA-seq data are from the effect of below-background radiation 5.5 nGy total dose (0.2nGy/hr) on E. coli grown shielded from natural radiation 655 m below ground in a pre-World War II steel vault. The gene expression response to three supplemented sources of radiation designed to mimic natural background, 1952 - 5720 nGy in total dose (71-208 nGy/hr), are compared to this "radiation-deprived" treatment. In addition, RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans nematode from similar radiation treatments was analyzed by three of the software packages.
RESULTS: In E. coli, the four software programs identified one of the supplementary sources of radiation (KCl) to evoke about 5 times more transcribed genes than the minus-radiation treatment (69-114 differentially expressed genes, DEGs), and so the rest of the analyses used this KCl vs "Minus" comparison. After imposing a 30-read minimum cutoff, one of the DNAStar options shared two of the three steps (mapping, normalization, and statistic) with Partek Flow (they both used median of ratios to normalize and the DESeq2 statistical package), and these two programs identified the highest number of DEGs in common with each other (53). In contrast, when the programs used different approaches in each of the three steps, between 31 and 40 DEGs were found in common. Regarding the extent of expression differences, three of the four programs gave high fold-change results (15-178 fold), but one (DNAstar's DESeq2) resulted in more conservative fold-changes (1.5-3.5). In a parallel study comparing three qPCR commercial validation software programs, these programs also gave variable results as to which genes were significantly regulated. Similarly, the C. elegans analysis showed exaggerated fold-changes in CLC and DNAstar's edgeR while DNAstar-D was more conservative.
CONCLUSIONS: Regarding the extent of expression (fold-change), and considering the subtlety of the very low level radiation treatments, in E. coli three of the four programs gave what we consider exaggerated fold-change results (15 - 178 fold), but one (DNAstar's DESeq2) gave more realistic fold-changes (1.5-3.5). When RT-qPCR validation comparisons to transcriptome results were carried out, they supported the more conservative DNAstar-D's expression results. When another model organism's (nematode) response to these radiation differences was similarly analyzed, DNAstar-D also resulted in the most conservative expression patterns. Therefore, we would propose DESeq2 ("DNAstar-D") as an appropriate software tool for differential gene expression studies for treatments expected to give subtle transcriptome responses.},

	abstract = {In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a very widely used technology for profiling gene expression. One of the most common aims of RNA-seq profiling is to identify genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed (DE) between two or more biological conditions. This article demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-seq data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the edgeR package. The differential expression analysis uses the quasi-likelihood functionality of edgeR.},

@article{Amrhein2017aa,
	abstract = {The widespread use of 'statistical significance' as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading p-values into 'significant' and 'nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small p-values at face value, but mistrust results with larger p-values. In either case, p-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (p ≤ 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80%, two studies will be 'conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, p-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, p-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger p-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that 'there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger p-values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that p-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.},

@article{Montero2023aa,
	abstract = {Over recent years many statisticians and researchers have highlighted that statistical inference would benefit from a better use and understanding of hypothesis testing, p-values, and statistical significance. We highlight three recommendations in the context of biochemical sciences. First recommendation: to improve the biological interpretation of biochemical data, do not use p-values (or similar test statistics) as thresholded values to select biomolecules. Second recommendation: to improve comparison among studies and to achieve robust knowledge, perform complete reporting of data. Third recommendation: statistical analyses should be reported completely with exact numbers (not as asterisks or inequalities). Owing to the high number of variables, a better use of statistics is of special importance in omic studies.},

@article{Mayo2022aa,
	abstract = {While the common procedure of statistical significance testing and its accompanying concept of p-values have long been surrounded by controversy, renewed concern has been triggered by the replication crisis in science. Many blame statistical significance tests themselves, and some regard them as sufficiently damaging to scientific practice as to warrant being abandoned. We take a contrary position, arguing that the central criticisms arise from misunderstanding and misusing the statistical tools, and that in fact the purported remedies themselves risk damaging science. We argue that banning the use of p-value thresholds in interpreting data does not diminish but rather exacerbates data-dredging and biasing selection effects. If an account cannot specify outcomes that will not be allowed to count as evidence for a claim-if all thresholds are abandoned-then there is no test of that claim. The contributions of this paper are: To explain the rival statistical philosophies underlying the ongoing controversy; To elucidate and reinterpret statistical significance tests, and explain how this reinterpretation ameliorates common misuses and misinterpretations; To argue why recent recommendations to replace, abandon, or retire statistical significance undermine a central function of statistics in science: to test whether observed patterns in the data are genuine or due to background variability.},

In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user.

@article{McCarthy2009oo,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Statistical methods are used to test for the differential expression of genes in microarray experiments. The most widely used methods successfully test whether the true differential expression is different from zero, but give no assurance that the differences found are large enough to be biologically meaningful.
RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes.
AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is contributed to the software package limma available at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

Recently, there are controversies over its utility and over the possible relationship between p-value misuse and the relatively high proportion of published medical research that cannot be replicated. In this paper, we introduce the p-value in layman's terms and explain its randomness and limitations. However, we also point out that the available alternatives to p-value suffer similar limitations. We conclude that using p values is a valid way to test the null and alternative hypotheses in clinical trials. However, using the p-value from a single statistical test to judge the scientific merit of a research project is a misuse of the p-value; the results of inference tests using p-values need to be integrated with secondary results and other data to arrive at clinically valid conclusions. Understanding the variability and limitations of the p-value is important for the interpretation of statistical results in research studies. },

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constructing gene coexpression networks is a powerful approach for analyzing high-throughput gene expression data towards module identification, gene function prediction, and disease-gene prioritization. While optimal workflows for constructing coexpression networks, including good choices for data pre-processing, normalization, and network transformation, have been developed for microarray-based expression data, such well-tested choices do not exist for RNA-seq data. Almost all studies that compare data processing and normalization methods for RNA-seq focus on the end goal of determining differential gene expression.
RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking and analysis of 36 different workflows, each with a unique set of normalization and network transformation methods, for constructing coexpression networks from RNA-seq datasets. We test these workflows on both large, homogenous datasets and small, heterogeneous datasets from various labs. We analyze the workflows in terms of aggregate performance, individual method choices, and the impact of multiple dataset experimental factors. Our results demonstrate that between-sample normalization has the biggest impact, with counts adjusted by size factors producing networks that most accurately recapitulate known tissue-naive and tissue-aware gene functional relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this work, we provide concrete recommendations on robust procedures for building an accurate coexpression network from an RNA-seq dataset. In addition, researchers can examine all the results in great detail at https://krishnanlab.github.io/RNAseq_coexpression to make appropriate choices for coexpression analysis based on the experimental factors of their RNA-seq dataset.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to correctly decode phenotypic information from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, careful selection of the RNA-seq quantification measure is critical for inter-sample comparisons and for downstream analyses, such as differential gene expression between two or more conditions. Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis.
METHODS: In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data.
CONCLUSION: We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.},

@article{McCarthy2012,
	abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.
RESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data.
CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

Often overlooked, data preprocessing is an essential step in data analysis: the presence of unreliable features and noise can affect the conclusions drawn from downstream analyses. Using a spike-in dilution study, we evaluated the effects of several general-purpose aligners (BWA, Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and Novoalign), and normalization methods (counts-per-million, total count scaling, upper quartile scaling, Trimmed Mean of M, DESeq, linear regression, cyclic loess and quantile) with respect to the final miRNA count data distribution, variance, bias and accuracy of differential expression analysis. We make practical recommendations on the optimal preprocessing methods for the extraction and interpretation of miRNA count data from small RNA-sequencing experiments. },

@article{Dillies2013,
	abstract = {During the last 3 years, a number of approaches for the normalization of RNA sequencing data have emerged in the literature, differing both in the type of bias adjustment and in the statistical strategy adopted. However, as data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice. Based on this comparison study, we propose practical recommendations on the appropriate normalization method to be used and its impact on the differential analysis of RNA-seq data. },

@article{Lin2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A generally accepted approach to the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data does not yet exist. We sequenced the mRNA of 726 individuals from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel in order to quantify differences in gene expression among single flies. One of our experimental goals was to identify the optimal analysis approach for the detection of differential gene expression among the factors we varied in the experiment: genotype, environment, sex, and their interactions. Here we evaluate three different filtering strategies, eight normalization methods, and two statistical approaches using our data set. We assessed differential gene expression among factors and performed a statistical power analysis using the eight biological replicates per genotype, environment, and sex in our data set.
RESULTS: We found that the most critical considerations for the analysis of RNA-Seq read count data were the normalization method, underlying data distribution assumption, and numbers of biological replicates, an observation consistent with previous RNA-Seq and microarray analysis comparisons. Some common normalization methods, such as Total Count, Quantile, and RPKM normalization, did not align the data across samples. Furthermore, analyses using the Median, Quantile, and Trimmed Mean of M-values normalization methods were sensitive to the removal of low-expressed genes from the data set. Although it is robust in many types of analysis, the normal data distribution assumption produced results vastly different than the negative binomial distribution. In addition, at least three biological replicates per condition were required in order to have sufficient statistical power to detect expression differences among the three-way interaction of genotype, environment, and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The best analysis approach to our data was to normalize the read counts using the DESeq method and apply a generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution using either edgeR or DESeq software. Genes having very low read counts were removed after normalizing the data and fitting it to the negative binomial distribution. We describe the results of this evaluation and include recommended analysis strategies for RNA-Seq read count data.},

@article{Liu2019,
	abstract = {Dozens of normalization methods for correcting experimental variation and bias in high-throughput expression data have been developed during the last two decades. Up to 23 methods among them consider the skewness of expression data between sample states, which are even more than the conventional methods, such as loess and quantile. From the perspective of reference selection, we classified the normalization methods for skewed expression data into three categories, data-driven reference, foreign reference, and entire gene set. We separately introduced and summarized these normalization methods designed for gene expression data with global shift between compared conditions, including both microarray and RNA-seq, based on the reference selection strategies. To our best knowledge, this is the most comprehensive review of available preprocessing algorithms for the unbalanced transcriptome data. The anatomy and summarization of these methods shed light on the understanding and appropriate application of preprocessing methods.},

@article{Marioni2008,
	abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},
